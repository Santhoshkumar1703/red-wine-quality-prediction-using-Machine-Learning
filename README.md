# red-wine-quality-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
By these work we have work on data pre processing and predicting the quality of wine.
Data sets in red wine that contain one or more missing feature values (incomplete data). Many
existing industrial and research data sets contain missing values due to various reasons, such as
manual data entry procedures, equipment errors and incorrect measurements. The important
factor for selection of approach to missing values is missing data mechanism. In our red wine
data set there are various strategies for dealing with missing values. we exposed the concept to
improve the imputation technique more worthy than other techniques that Clustering imputation
Algorithm proposed which reduce the error rate of imputed value for missing data into red wine
database.
